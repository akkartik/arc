- Features so far
'$' for escaping to scheme
http://awwx.ws/defarc for making scheme extensible from arc
Dynamic scope: http://awwx.ws/implicit

Extensible coerce (rntz; http://arclanguage.org/item?id=9828)
Macros can be defined in any order.

All functions are generic and can be extended for new conditions
using 'defextend'.
  (Previous discussions: http://arclanguage.org/item?id=11779,
  http://arclanguage.org/item?id=11865, http://arclanguage.org/item?id=13790)

pervasive keyword args. If a function f has params (a b c), (f :c 3 1 2) <=> (f 1 2 3), etc.
new arglist syntax. (a b ? c c1 d d1 . e) => c and d are optional, with
defaults c1 and d1 respectively.

transparent persistence using 'persisted', which can be extended for new
datatypes by supporting the generics 'serialize' and 'unserialize'.

srv:
  parse IP from X-Forwarded-For
  access static subdirectories
  more mime-types, more html attributes, more useful logging
  correctly sends crlf-terminated lines

Bugfixes:
  readline handles empty lines: http://awwx.ws/readline, http://arclanguage.org/item?id=10830
  downcase/upcase on nil return nil: http://arclanguage.org/item?id=10793
  each over tables returns nil

Case can work on lists and other compounds

- Incompatibilities and gotchas
1. nil == (); type.nil == nil.
2. Optional args have a new syntax. (a (o b) (o c 3)) => (a ? b nil c 3)
3. some and keep don't testify.
4. Always handle null values when defining a generic
5. srv no longer calls setuid. Run it behind apache or nginx, never as root.
6. thread and new-thread require docstrings, like in autosave-thread in state.arc.
7. case no longer autoquotes: http://arclanguage.org/item?id=13234
8. List operations treat non-lists as degenerate dotted lists by default.
